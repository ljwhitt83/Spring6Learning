# This section of the application.properties file is used for configuring the generation of SQL scripts
# when transitioning from an in-memory database to an actual database.

# The 'spring.jpa.properties.jakarta.persistence.schema-generation.scripts.action' property is used to specify
# the action that should be taken by the schema generation scripts. In this case, the action is set to 'drop-and-create',
# which means that the existing schema will be dropped and a new one will be created.

#spring.jpa.properties.jakarta.persistence.schema-generation.scripts.action=drop-and-create

# The 'spring.jpa.properties.jakarta.persistence.schema-generation.scripts.create-source' property is used to specify
# the source for the creation scripts. In this case, the source is set to 'metadata', which means that the scripts
# will be generated from the metadata.

#spring.jpa.properties.jakarta.persistence.schema-generation.scripts.create-source=metadata

# The 'spring.jpa.properties.jakarta.persistence.schema-generation.scripts.drop-target' property is used to specify
# the target for the drop scripts. In this case, the target is set to 'drop-and-create.sql', which means that the scripts
# will be written to a file named 'drop-and-create.sql'.

#spring.jpa.properties.jakarta.persistence.schema-generation.scripts.drop-target=drop-and-create.sql

# The 'spring.jpa.properties.jakarta.persistence.schema-generation.scripts.create-target' property is used to specify
# the target for the creation scripts. In this case, the target is also set to 'drop-and-create.sql', which means that
# the creation scripts will be written to the same file as the drop scripts.

#spring.jpa.properties.jakarta.persistence.schema-generation.scripts.create-target=drop-and-create.sql
